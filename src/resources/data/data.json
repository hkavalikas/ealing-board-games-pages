    "firstAboutUsParagraph": "We are a community of beginners and veterans alike; a bunch of people that just like\n to sit around and play board games. If you are interested in board games, whether it\n be learning or playing, we have a seat for you. Come say hello!",
    "secondAboutUsParagraph": "We meet weekly at Ealing Broadway, most events are free to attend but please\n refer to the events calendar for the specifics.\n Please arrive between 18:20-19:00, any later and it becomes harder to jump into a\n game, there's no need to book, just turn up!",
    "thirdAboutUsParagraph": " The club and its events are first and foremost aimed at adults. Children are\n welcome as long as they are supervised at all times by a parent or\n carer. The organisers take no responsibility or liability for unsupervised\n children. Please note that there could be games present that may not be suitable\n for children.",
